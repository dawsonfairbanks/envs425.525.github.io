## Readings, Lectures and Videos

There is no required textbook for this class. All readings and external content 
will be provided for you, either within the course as a downloadable file 
(.doc, .pdf, etc.) or as a clickable link. We will be working primarily from
 Environmental Microbiology, 3rd Edition (Pepper, Gerba, Gentry). ISBN: 978-0-12-394626-3 
 that is available from the [University of Arizona Library Web Page](https://new.library.arizona.edu/). 
 Select PDF chapters will be made available on D2L.
 
## Required Materials

You must have Internet access for the duration of the course. In addition, it is strongly recommended that you have access to a computer (laptop or desktop) to complete assignments and activities. While a phone or tablet may be good for quick check-ins, they are not always ideal for completing your coursework.
