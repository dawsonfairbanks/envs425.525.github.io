# Keys to Success <br>
### Where and when do we meet as a class
We will be using Desire2Learn (D2L), which is the program you are currently logged into. 
You will find your readings, videos, discussions, assignments, and quizzes here.

### Where can I find information on what assignments are due each week?

From the Content link in the top menu bar, you will find different modules holding the 
material that you will complete each week of the course. So for example, in Module 1, 
you will find the readings, assignments, and discussions that you need to complete by the 
due dates listed for that module. A detailed breakdown of the course schedule can be found 
in the course syllabus. Pay attention to this syllabus and it is your responsibility as a 
student to turn in assignments at their specified due dates. I suggest entering in 
assignment due dates as well as quizzes and exams into your calendar at the beginning 
of the semester.

### What is the policy on due dates and late work?

As this is a fully online class and the location is flexible, you must be available for 
the duration of the course. I expect that you will log into the system at least a few
 times a week (preferably every day or every other day) to engage in this workshop. This 
 will also help keep you connected to what is going on in the course. It can be easy to 
 misjudge how much time has passed since you last checked into an online course; but 
 by getting into a routine of checking in (about) daily, you'll feel more connected to 
 the course and engaged in what is going on. Participation is an expectation. Because 
 you are allowed to drop one checkpoint assessment, I do not offer make up assessments 
 or assignments for extra credit. You are responsible for meeting all deadlines and 
 assessments outlined in the syllabus. Assignments will not be accepted late under any 
 circumstances, they may however, be turned in early. Missed assessments may not be 
 made up except for extraordinary circumstances.

### How do I get a hold of you?

In general, the best way to contact me using the information provided in my Landing Page 
or on my Syllabus. I check my email often and it is the best way to reach me. 
I will do my best to return all emails within 24 hours during the work week (Monday - Friday). 
Emails received after 4:30 on Friday will be returned the following Monday. Need to chat 
about something specific or more in-depth? Feel free to reach out and ask to schedule an 
appointment. I am happy to find a time that works for both of us to talk preferably by Zoom.

### So this class will be less work than a traditional face-to-face class?

This is a common misconception that online classes are inherently easier than face-to-face 
classes. In actuality, they are quite different in structure, pacing, and the way that 
you have to manage your time in order to be successful. While you will be meeting the 
same outcomes and learning the same material as a face-to-face class, the way that you 
participate changes. You lose the synchronous element (i.e., sitting in a chair in a 
room on campus with me and your classmates), but you gain a good deal more asynchronous 
reading, writing, listening, thinking, and responding.

### How do I get my assignments to you?

You will be able to access your grades via D2L Grades, via the “Grades” function. 
Please feel free to ask any questions at any point or let me know if you have 
any concerns about this.

### How do I access my grades?

You will submit all coursework online via D2L. I will never ask you to physically 
turn anything into me in person and I will not accept work emailed to me. If you have an 
issue submitting your assignments in D2L, please let me know and I am happy to help you 
troubleshoot. You can also get in touch with 
[24/7 support](https://it.arizona.edu/service/247-it-support) if you're having a 
technical or connection issues.
